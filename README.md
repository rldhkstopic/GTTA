# Online Test-time Adaptation
This is an open source online test-time adaptation repository based on PyTorch. It is joint work by Robert A. Marsden and Mario DÃ¶bler. It is also the official repository for the following works:
- [Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07736)
- [Robust Mean Teacher for Continual and Gradual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13081) (CVPR2023)
- [Universal Test-time Adaptation through Weight Ensembling, Diversity Weighting, and Prior Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00650) (WACV2024)


## Segmentation

For running the experiments based on CarlaTTA, you first have to download the dataset splits as provided below. Again, you probably have to change the data directory `_C.DATA_DIR = "./data"` in `conf.py`. Further, you have to download the pre-trained source checkpoints ([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PoeW-GnFr374j-J76H8udblSwrae74LQ/view?usp=sharing)) and extract the zip-file within the `segmentation` subdirectory.

E.g., to run GTTA, use the config file provided in the directory `cfgs` and run:
```
python test_time.py --cfg cfgs/gtta.yaml
```

You can also change the test sequences by setting `LIST_NAME_TEST` to:
+ day2night: `day_night_1200.txt`
+ clear2fog: `clear_fog_1200.txt`
+ clear2rain: `clear_rain_1200.txt`
+ dynamic: `dynamic_1200.txt`
+ highway: `town04_dynamic_1200.txt`

If you choose highway as the test sequence, you have to change the source list and the corresponding checkpoint paths.
```bash
python test_time.py --cfg cfgs/gtta.yaml LIST_NAME_SRC clear_highway_train.txt LIST_NAME_TEST town04_dynamic_1200.txt CKPT_PATH_SEG ./ckpt/clear_highway/ckpt_seg.pth CKPT_PATH_ADAIN_DEC = ./ckpt/clear_highway/ckpt_adain.pth
```
